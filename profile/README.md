## Course Description
An introduction to creation of effective documents and documentation using industry-standard approaches to creating and treating “documentation as code.” Participating in project-based and hands-on activities, students create purpose-driven digital writing with special attention to forms, formats, and conventions expected of contemporary technical communication. Students also gain experience with creating collaborative and ethically-consistent content working in a team-based setting. During a weekly laboratory session students employ contemporary software tools to complete technical documentation projects, reporting on their results through both written reflections and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.
